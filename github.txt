To Save work on github and so we don't lose any previous work I have connected a github repository to back up our data. Whenever you want to save date 
on the left below the files button click version control, add a description about the version and click Commit & push. This saves the version

if you know git here is the info you need:

 OAuth token:
 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

 Github username:
 David-Safro

 NOTE:
 IF YOU NEED TO RESTORE A VERSION CONTACT DAVID DON'T DO IT YOURSELF IT IS VERY EASY TO MESS UP THE ENTIRE PROJECT
