A great evil has befallen Ambiä, World of Light. Like a mist of darkness, slowly decending on the land, slowly hiding away the light.

Each night is darker than the last.

Each day the sun, dimmer.

If this continues, Ambiä's inhabitants will perish.

...

But there is hope.

According to legend, heroes of old were able to control Vu Ralden, Beast of Shadow, using the fabled Shadow Helm. It was a time of great prosperity and peace.

But one day it fell into the wrong hands. The evil sorcerer Varnez used Vu Ralden to gain control of the people of Ambiä through force.

One day a hero by the name of Yunik stepped up and fought for freedom. After a long and gruesome battle, Yunik obtained The Shadow Helm and sealded Vu Ralden away.

But nothing could stop it forever.

Yunik knew he could not keep Vu Ralden contained indefinetley. Not wanting it to fall into the hands of evil again, his final act was to shatter the Shadow Helm into four peices and scatter them across different worlds.

One piece rests in the mountains of Ambiä, World of Light.

Another lies in the watery dpeths of Varbrör, The Dream World.

The third is amongst the clouds of Selnia, The Sky World.

The fourth and final piece was sent to Durmön, The Dark World. It is said to rest "close to the home of a hero."

Yunik died knowing only a true hero could traverse all four worlds and reassemble The Shadow Helm when the time came.

And the time has come. You, young hero, must go to the mountains and find the Shadow Helm piece that rests in this world.
