---

Multiplayer battle royal style game
(don't judge pls its worth putting it in here)

---

scrolling platformer game

I don't know exactly what we're going to do, but I think some sort of comic mischief is in order. That's always fun, and it's an easy thing to make. If not, we could also try a short story game. we really don't need more than an hour or so of gameplay, and if we have until march, that should be fine.

I think it would be cool to have some sort of multiplayer involved because that probably would always impress people

If you look in the ideas.draw file, you'll see that there's a box with rectangles around it.
The box is the solid object, and the rectangles are hitboxes.



let me finish first...

The arrows are the ways you can "solid warp" around the corners. the numbers are the order in which the hitboxes are checked for player touching. The problem is, when you're going up and left on the bottom, it's rendering the right side hitbox before the bottom one, and that's why you're warping to the corner. Because you're technically still inside the box and touching it. that's why you can only warp to things rendered before (e.g. 4 to 3, 3 to 2, 2 to 1, and 4 to 1.)

Do you understand?
uh its an interesting method for sure not what I would have gone for but yeah.I have some free time so I will try and fix it or at least underestand it better
yeah Im not sure I will be able to but Ill try hard

ok. soon school will end and I'll be able to do a zoom (I hope)

Make it so that when the screen reaches the edge of the map, the player will move so you don't see the blackness outside the map.
